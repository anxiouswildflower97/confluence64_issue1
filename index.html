                        <h4 class = "introtext">The inspiration for issue one of Confluence64</h4>
                        <p class = "introtext">Hello reader! I hope you are fine and dandy! Welcome to Confluence64! A zine by yours truly, Carson Snow (that's me!) The idea for Confluence64 came to me in November of 2022 on Thanksgiving Day. My sister was working, and my parents had a dinner planned with some of their friends. To entertain myself, I started rummaging through my stuff and came across the postcard you see below (without the writing, that came afterwards.) I had bought this postcard in a shop on Bainbridge Island in Washington State back in February of 2022 with the intention of giving it to a friend of mine. I had forgotten to, and in all honesty, had forgotten about the postcard all together, until I came across it that night.</p>
                        <p class = "introtext">I started thinking about how the year was coming to an end in a matter of weeks. It was a tumultuous journey. 2022 will be remembered as one of the more defining years of my life. I experienced many new things and gained great memories. At the same time, those memories were being overcast by the rougher periods of my year.</p>
                        <p class = "introtext">I recognized that I wasn't going to be able to start 2023 on the right foot if I didn't allow myself to process everything that happened over the past year. I wouldn't be able to experience joy if I didn't acknowledge the pain I've held onto, experience growth if I didn't lower my ego and recognize my flaws, or feel confidence in myself if I didn't forgive myself. I wouldn't be able to live freely until I saw myself as someone worthy of doing so.</p>
                        <p class = "introtext">And so, I picked up the postcard and a pencil and started drawing in an effort to capture the key moments of the last year. I opened YouTube and Spotify and started listening to the music that was most played during those time periods to travel back to specific moments and memories that are near and dear to me. And little by little, as I opened my mind and heart, I was reliving the defining moments of the past year. Through this experience, I was able to acknowledge my pain, be critical of myself and see where I was wrong, be gentler on my self as I recalled moments where I was too harsh, and be proud of myself for making it through all of it in one piece. I was able to feel happiness for the many good memories that were made despite the chaos that was happening.</p>
                        <p class = "introtext">This zine would have been more complete if I had the journal that I kept during this time. Unfortunately, I had thrown it out in a garbage can at the Brooklyn Bridge. That was a dumb decision. That journal, in addition to my entries, also had mementos like concert tickets, receipts from my trip to Seattle, receipts from times that I hung out with other people, little cards, stuff like that. Now that I don't have those things, it almost seems as none of those things ever happened.</p>
			            <p class = "introtext">Initially, I was going to recreate those journal entries. However, the rewritten entries were not as authentic, raw, and honest as the originals. Hindsight takes over instead. And frankly, I’m not the best writer. Towards the end of the summer of 2022, I found the book “Daytripper” by Fàbio Moon and Gabriel Bà on a staircase of a brownstone in Brooklyn Heights. It was like kismet because the book ended up helping me through an emotional autumn. As I read the book, I came across so many excerpts that reminded me of moments that occurred throughout the year. And so, instead of journal entries, each memory will be accompanied by excerpts from “Daytripper” that remind me of those moments, whatever notes I have taken in my planner and phone during those times, and the music that was played during those time periods. Through creating these drawings, selecting excerpts from "Daytripper" and curating playlists of music I listened to most during those times, I was able to recreate those mementos - though they are not the original thing, this zine is special in its own way. Something to keep in mind as you read the excerpts from “Daytripper” is there are a few that aren’t in regards to my perspective, but of other people in my life. The nice thing about “Daytripper” is that it is a book that most everyone can relate to in their own unique way. I highly recommend reading it - the illustrations are evocative and the writing is moving. It’s timeless in that it is relevant no matter what wave you are currently riding.</p>
                        <p class = "introtext">When I started this zine, I never had any intention of sharing it with anyone. I started working on it to cope with some strong feelings I was experiencing at the time. The reason that I decided to share it upon its completion is because I recognize that I’m not the only one who feels like life is one, big sticky mess. Something that I’ve come to realize is that those sticky situations play an important part in our development and defining the trajectory of our life. In hindsight, those sticky situations are what differentiates between just existing versus living. I was hoping to have had this done by the end of December 2022 or beginning of January 2023. However, procrastination is a curse and this was an emotional process as well that required some breathing time in between. I kind of feel silly for releasing this into the third month of 2023. I felt like giving up sometimes because it felt like it was too late to be sharing a zine about 2022. However, finishing this project was necessary for me on a personal level. And also, better late than never, right? I hope that my journey and this zine helps provide some brings joy or inspiration to those reading it.</p>
                        <p class = "introtext">Thank you to the people in my life who were there for me during rough times, who were a friend to me, who saw the best in me even when I felt like a loser, and for opening my eyes to a world that was under my nose this whole time. I wish you are all well, wherever you are.</p>
                        <p class = "introtext">With love,</p>

                        <p class = "daytripper">Bràs: No one really does. But, truth is, like it or not, everybody dies. Life is like a book, son. And every book has an end. No matter how much you like that book, you will get to the last page, and it will end. No book is complete without its end. And once you get, only when you read the last words, will you see how good the book is. It feels real.</p>

                        <p class = "daytripper">We live in a society populated by strangers. Each day, we feel more distance from each other, more alone, all while being surrounded by millions. Each day we watch as our city turns into a desert, one in which we are all lost – looking for that oasis we like to call… “love.” How do we find something – or someone – we can no longer see, but which is right there before us? And how do we hold on to what is most precious in life?</p>

                        <p class = "OGMemories">Have a great summer and thanks for letting me know about the retirement party for Ms.XXX. It was nice to see everyone outside the building and to hang out with them for a little bit.</p>

                        <p class = "OGMemories">Me: Hope all is well with you. I know you said you were going to the West Coast in August. If youʼve reached, let me know how it is. Iʼll just experience it vicariously since my plans to go havenʼt quite worked out. Have fun!</p>

My dad has a minor leg surgery this week and next week and then we have a wedding the end of next week. Iʼm free the week of August 29th though. Were you able to head up to Seattle like you planned?

Even though everyday life resumed its course and people got back to their chores, now Bràs knew life awaited him out there. The house was no longer able to keep him locked inside.

                        <p class = "OGMemories">From my email - on October 21, 2021, I emailed all my professors to let them know I'm dropping out of my classes:</p>
                        <p class = "OGMemories">While I enjoy being part of the program and learning from and alongside such brilliant people, unfortunately I must withdraw from my courses this semester. It was a hard decision to come to. I tried to make compromises across family, work, and school but ultimately the quality of output across all three facets were sacrificed. It is important that I am doing my job well as that is a major priority, financially and personally. I do apologize for leaving in the middle of the semester. As the primary breadwinner in my house, I can’t afford to not give it higher priority. The program is fantastic and I hope that I am able to change my current situation so that school can be part of it. However, that isn’t likely to occur until next year due to certain circumstances. My apologies and wishing you a great rest of the semester.</p>
                        <p class = "OGMemories">Context: Work was overwhelming as this was our first "normal" school year since Spring of 2020. On top of that, my health (mental, emotional, physical) was all over the place. I was passing out on the stairs when I'd come home from work. And I started cutting as a way to cope with the stress. I dropped out because I've always loved school and I really enjoy learning - I want to be able to be present to take it all in and experience it. If I can't, then what's the point?</p>

Bràs had all the time in the world to figure that out. He discovered your country can be your home, or a city, or just that particular neighborhood. Sometimes your life changes, you change, and your home moves to a different place.</p>
                        <p class = "daytripper">Bràs realized that home is not a physical place at all, but a group of elements like the people you live with - a feeling, a state of mind. He feels safer just knowing that even if he’s away, there is a home waiting for him to return. It’s where he can rest. Where he finds peace.</p>

                        <p></p>
                        <p class = "daytripper">People have always believed in miracles. It’s in their nature to believe things can always get better in some mysterious way. If everything else fails, higher forces will help them when the time comes. And people do that because they know the very essence of life is that from the very beginning, at any point, everything can go wrong.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p class = "daytripper">And you’ve always got my back. I take good care of you, and you take care of me. You’re my best friend… you never let me down.</p>
