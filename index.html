                        <h4>The inspiration for issue one of Confluence64</h4>
                        <p>Hello reader! I hope you are fine and dandy! Welcome to Confluence64! A zine by yours truly, Carson Snow (that's me!) The idea for Confluence64 came to me in November of 2022 on Thanksgiving Day. My sister was working and my parents had a dinner planned with some of their friends. In an effort to entertain myself, I started rummaging through my stuff and came across the postcard you see below (without the writing, that came afterwards.) I had bought this postcard in a shop on Bainbridge Island in Washington State back in February of 2022 with the intention of giving it to a friend of mine. I had forgotten to, and in all honesty, had forgotten about the postcard all together, until I came across it that night.</p>
                        <p>I started thinking about how the year was coming to an end in a matter of weeks. I began recounting all that had happened since August of 2021 (yes, I am aware that the new year starts in the month of January. However, the story of 2022 wouldn't be complete without the acknowledging the events that occurred in the fall of 2021). It was a tumultuous journey. 2022 will definitely be remembered as one of the more defining years of my life. I experienced many new things and gained great memories. At the same time, those memories were being overcast by the rougher periods of my year as I hit rock bottom. Ultimately, I stopped thinking about it all together because it brought in me a sadness and remorse for the note that the year was ending on.</p>
                        <p>However, I recognized that I wasn't going to be able to start 2023 on the right foot if I didn't allow myself to process everything that happened over the past year. I wouldn't be able to experience joy if I didn't acknowledge the pain I've held onto. I wouldn't be able to experience growth if I didn't lower my ego and recognize my flaws. I wouldn't be able to feel confidence in myself if I didn't forgive myself. I wouldn't be able to live freely until I saw myself as someone worthy of doing so.</p>
                        <p>And so, I picked up the postcard and a pencil and started drawing in an effort to capture the key moments of the last year. I opened up my Youtube and Spotify and started listening to the music that was most played during those time periods to travel back to specific moments and memories that were near and dear to me. And little by little, as I opened my mind and heart, I was reliving the defining moments of the past year. Through this experience, I was able to acknowledge the pain and the reasons behind it. I was able to be critical of myself and see where I was in the wrong. I was able to be gentler on myself as I recalled moments where I felt small and was harsh on myself rather than providing grace. I was able to be proud of myself for making it through all that in one piece, a little cracked and bruised, but nothing that time can't heal.</p>
                        <p>This zine would have been more complete if I had the journal that I kept during this time. Unfortunately, I had thrown it out in a garbage can on the Brooklyn Bridge. The reason for this stupid action was because I wanted to rid myself of certain memories. The memories remained, but the raw accounts documented at those precise moments are gone forever. I tried to retell the stories behind each sketch to the best of my ability. However, it will never be as raw and real as those diary entries that I had written.</p>
                        <p>The reason I want to share this zine with you is because I know that I'm not alone in feeling like life is too overwhelming. That feeling of life moving too fast and you falling and tripping in an attempt to keep up. Those days where it feels like you're not worth it and there's no point to anything. Constantly feeling like a failure, nothing you do is ever right or ever will be. But, if you take a moment to look back, you'll see that despite all that, you've accomplished so much. You being here today is an accomplishment. You doing what you need to do through it all is an accomplishment. You being there for the people you care about is an accomplishment. Those things may seem small, I know they did to me, but they truly are not. I hope that my journey and this zine helps provide some validation, support, inspiration, and/or joy for anyone experiencing the highs and lows of life.</p>
                        <p>With love,</p>
                        <p>Carson Snow</p>
