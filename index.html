                        <h4>The inspiration for issue one of Confluence64</h4>
                        <p>Hello reader! I hope you are fine and dandy! Welcome to Confluence64! A zine by yours truly, Carson Snow (that's me!) The idea for Confluence64 came to me in November of 2022 on Thanksgiving Day. My sister was working, and my parents had a dinner planned with some of their friends. To entertain myself, I started rummaging through my stuff and came across the postcard you see below (without the writing, that came afterwards.) I had bought this postcard in a shop on Bainbridge Island in Washington State back in February of 2022 with the intention of giving it to a friend of mine. I had forgotten to, and in all honesty, had forgotten about the postcard all together, until I came across it that night.</p>
                        <p>I started thinking about how the year was coming to an end in a matter of weeks. I began recounting all that had happened since August of 2021 (yes, I am aware that the new year starts in the month of January. However, the story of 2022 wouldn't be complete without the acknowledging the events that occurred in the fall of 2021). It was a tumultuous journey. 2022 will be remembered as one of the more defining years of my life. I experienced many new things and gained great memories. At the same time, those memories were being overcast by the rougher periods of my year as I hit rock bottom. Ultimately, I stopped thinking about it all together because it brought in me a sadness and remorse for the note that the year was ending on.</p>
                        <p>However, I recognized that I wasn't going to be able to start 2023 on the right foot if I didn't allow myself to process everything that happened over the past year. I wouldn't be able to experience joy if I didn't acknowledge the pain I've held onto. I wouldn't be able to experience growth if I didn't lower my ego and recognize my flaws. I wouldn't be able to feel confidence in myself if I didn't forgive myself. I wouldn't be able to live freely until I saw myself as someone worthy of doing so.</p>
                        <p>And so, I picked up the postcard and a pencil and started drawing in an effort to capture the key moments of the last year. I opened YouTube and Spotify and started listening to the music that was most played during those time periods to travel back to specific moments and memories that were near and dear to me. And little by little, as I opened my mind and heart, I was reliving the defining moments of the past year. Through this experience, I was able to acknowledge the pain and the reasons behind it. I was able to be critical of myself and see where I was in the wrong. I was able to be gentler on myself as I recalled moments where I felt small and was harsh on myself rather than providing grace. I was able to be proud of myself for making it through all that in one piece, a little cracked and bruised, but nothing that time can't heal. I was able to feel happiness for the many good memories that were made despite the chaos that was happening.</p>
                        <p>This zine would have been more complete if I had the journal that I kept during this time. Unfortunately, I had thrown it out in a garbage can on the Brooklyn Bridge. That was a dumb decision. However, it provides me the opportunity to write these memories from a more reflective and positive stance. Those journal entries were very raw and were overpowered by the strong emotions I was experiencing as I wrote them down. A lot of them had a negative undertones. I get to rewrite those memories from a happier perspective now.</p>
                        <p>When I started this zine, I never had any intention of sharing it with anyone. I started working on it to cope with some strong feelings I was experiencing at the time. The reason that I decided to share it upon its completion is because I recognize that I’m not the only one who feels like life is one, big sticky mess. Something that I’ve come to realize is that those sticky situations play an important part in our development and defining the trajectory of our life. In hindsight, those sticky situations are what differentiates between just existing versus living. I hope that my journey and this zine helps provide some validation, support, inspiration, and/or joy for anyone experiencing the highs and lows of life.</p>
                        <p>With love,</p>
                        <p>Carson Snow</p>

                        <p class = "OGMemories">August 16, 2021</p>
                        <p class = "OGMemories">Hi Carson =)</p>
                        <p class = "OGMemories">I literally got back yesterday hahah I am working all this week and half of next week. I am cool to chill soon just let me know when you’re free, I can meet after work too.</p>

                        <p class = "OGMemories">Me: Oh cool. My number is XXX-XXX-XXXX. We could set up a time to meet. My dad has a minor leg surgery this week and next week and then we have a wedding the end of next week. Iʼm free the week of August 29th though. Were you able to head up to Seattle like you planned? Iʼve got a whole bunch of family in SeaTac and Kent.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p class = "OGMemories">And at this point, the conversation had moved to the form of texts.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>On September 1st, after coping with the death of a close family-friend and navigating life with a stupid ass neighbor, I was looking forward to meeting up with him for lunch. I was surprised he had suggested the idea of meeting up for food because we didn’t talk much aside from the basic good morning greeting when he’d pass by my desk to put his lunchbox in the fridge. That was the first thing that stood out - the lunchboxes. They were always bright and colorful, like the green turtle ninja one, which is the one that stood out most for me. I found it quite whimsical. It made him seem approachable, and to me, showed that he wasn’t too serious or stuffy.</p>
                        <p>We agreed to meet at Station House. We sat by the window at a high table that had bar stools as the seat. I remember thinking how awkward the act of seating yourself on a barstool is. You’re climbing up to sit down. It’s hard to adjust your seat closer to the table once seated because your feet don’t reach the ground. Then you have to get down, move the seat closer, and shimmy back up again. Sometimes the seat was taken too close to the table and then you have to repeat the process again.</p>
                        <p>I don’t remember the conversation all too well. I do remember he had interesting things to share, more interesting than anything I could have offered to the conversation. He travels, he sells clothes, he graduated from college early and started teaching at a young age, he already finished his master’s and is tenured. He was handsome. He had green eyes and had a good sense of style. You could tell that he was one of those rare men who look good with or without facial hair. He had a really nice smile - it embodied a strong confidence, but also humility and kindness. He was really good at maintaining eye contact with the people he spoke with.</p>
                        <p>It was nice to be able to take a step back and do some thing new. I didn’t have many friends growing up. The pandemic didn’t help with allowing opportunities to meet new people. I was excited about fostering new friendships. To have a group of people that I’m able to fit in with and spend time with. September 1st marks the beginning of a friendship. Finally, a friend.</p>

                        <p></p>
                        <p></p>

                        <h4>Akino</h4>
                        <p>Note to self - take the subway when visiting Elmhurst. I had been driving for almost an hour and had yet to find parking. The issue wasn’t that there was zero parking available, though parking is limited in this neighborhood. The problem was that almost every parking spot that I encountered required me to parallel park. It’s not that I can’t parallel park, but it’s hard to parallel park when there is so much traffic. And you could only hold up traffic in a one way for so long before you had to move on.</p>
                        <p>Eventually, I found a parking spot farther away from the place - a good 10 to 15 minute walk. Honestly, not bad. I was about to give up and go home. I had lost all hope of finding parking. There was an oddly high amount of empty spaces which made me feel like there was a high chance of coming back to either a) a parking ticket or b) a towed car. But, I took my chances and started walking to the restaurant.</p>
                        <p>Not only was I late, but it also meant that I’d be walking in to everyone there already, which made me nervous. If I was early or on time, I’d be walking in with other people which was less nerve wrecking. However, now I’m entering on my own, and everyone will be looking at me. And if I needed to squeeze through to sit somewhere because all the easier to sit in seats (seats on the corner, seats facing aisles) are taken, I think I might die internally. Sometimes the squeeze is tight and I end up feeling like an ogre because I’m barely making it through. My worst fear is that the day will come where my butt and thighs are too big to squeeze through and I get stuck.</p>
                        <p>While I was nervous, I was also excited. At around this point of fall 2021, I had dropped out of my master’s program. I didn’t want to, but I was having trouble managing work, school, and the extreme fatigue that I was experiencing. I was passing out on the stairs when I’d come home from work or school. I’d later learn that I was extremely iron deficient. Who would have thought a mineral could cause so much havoc? I was devastated. Not about the iron deficiency, but about dropping out of my master’s program. I already was starting later than I had intended. I took a gap year after graduating in 2019. Then, COVID happened so I decided 2020 wasn’t the best time to start. I felt like such a failure. But, at least I had something fun to look towards in the midst of all this.</p>
                        <p>Thankfully the seat was a corner seat so I saved myself the awkwardness of having to shimmy through to squeeze in somewhere. But, the seat was across from him and I knew I looked ugly as fuck, so that sucked ass. He looked great, but when didn’t he.</p>
                        <p>To make matters worse, everyone ordered already. What made that bad was that I didn’t know anything about sushi or Japanese cuisine as I never had it before. This was my first time. Since a buffet was ordered, I decided the best course of action was to try the food ordered for that. You can imagine my horror when most of the food ordered was raw fish. I tried a few pieces but it honestly wasn’t my cup of tea. Makes me think why is it easier to eat certain animals like chicken and turkey, but harder to digest (mentally and physically) things like raw fish? What in our mind makes one meat more “acceptable” to eat and others revolting at the thought of it? I don’t have an answer to this, but raw fish was a loss.</p>
                        <p>I ended up ordering some fries. No disrespect to Akino, but the fries were not good. Sushi is their expertise for sure. The fries were most definitely the frozen shoestring variety that can be found at grocery stores. </p>
                        <p>I remember thinking how great everyone looked. Youthful, bright, and vibrant. Enjoying their food, enjoying each others company. Conversing with such ease. I felt so out of place in comparison. Looking back, I think if I had attempted to loosen up and stop overthinking everything, it would have been better. I’d get way too in my head and think about all the wrong things instead of focusing on making a genuine connection with the person in front of me. I’d be thinking about how big my thighs looked when sitting on a chair, how my gray hairs must be shining like floss, how my acne must look so revolting, how ugly I am in comparison to the person in front of me. News flash - wrong things to think about when socializing. If this is all that is going through your head, you’re sabotaging yourself from getting to know great people who deserve to be given proper attention. You miss out on the chance of connecting with people in a meaningful way and the opportunity to foster these connections into something more. Don’t do this, there is a 99.9% chance that they probably aren’t thinking about this at all. And if they are, they are not the type of people you want to be with. </p>
                        <p>The night ended with dessert. I had red bean ice cream. It’s a very pretty color, but it tasted like vanilla ice cream to me so I’m not really sure if the purpose of the bean was to add natural color or if there was supposed to be an added flavor. But what do I know, I’m not a food critic.</p>
                        <p>Thankfully my car was still there and I did not receive a parking ticket. Despite how awkward I felt through the night, it was a change from how most of my nights were - at home watching tv. And he walked me to my car which was nice of him. I had to drive him back though since I had parked far from the restaurant. He sort of disappeared the second half of the night. I later learned that he had stepped out with another girl. I’m not going to lie, I kind of felt a little jealous. I never felt jealousy, but that day I did. I don’t like that feeling, it’s really icky. The reality was that he was way too out of my league in any capacity, romantic or platonic. </p>

                        <p></p>
                        <p></p>

                        <h4>Meadow Lake</h4>
                        <p>I remember watching a VSauce video on <a href="https://youtu.be/CPBJgpK0Ulc">how people disappear</a> 10 years ago. In the video he mentions in most jurisdictions, if someone is missing and isn’t found, after 5-7 years they are declared “dead in absentia.”</p>
                        <p>It got me thinking about the question of how does one go missing on their own accord? How does one just disappear and start a new life far away? I remember thinking it’s easier to run away and start over if you were on your own to begin with (i.e. no family or friends who would want to look for you). They would need to live on only cash because if they use their cards they would be found through their transaction history. In regards to shelter, their best bet would be living in an RV. The only problem is that maintenance would be expensive. A car would be cheaper, but then storage, cooking, and bathrooms pose potential issues. Bathrooms especially because I hate public bathrooms. For work they would need to work off the books because where would they put their checks? Not their bank account, then they’ll be found. Then came things that were more difficult to resolve, such as the issue of internet for your computer. You can’t have an internet service if you live in a vehicle - routers involve wiring and stuff. You could utilize hotspot, but that involves having a cell phone which could be used to find you. And how do you sign up for a cell phone plan without using your real identity? And then the fact that it is scary to be alone. What if you hear something or see something in the middle of the night? It’s only you and there is no comfort in that. After racking my brain and growing tired of coming up with solutions and alternatives to live your fullest life in hiding, I moved on because it really didn’t matter to 15 year old me.</p>
                        <p>Except it mattered to 23 year old me. Every waking moment I would think about leaving everyone and everything. I would think about going somewhere new and starting over every single day. I was overwhelmed by my job. I felt like a failure for dropping out of all my classes. I was tired all the time. I constantly felt like I had the wind knocked out of me. I’d know, it happened once when I was 9 years old. My neighbor, who was older the me, got mad at me for touching his football. He socked me right in the stomach. I felt like that constantly. I hated that none of the pieces in my life were fitting. It’s like I was trying to put together a puzzle with pieces that were all from a different set. I was tired of my life and I was tired of myself. I hated myself. I was disgusted by myself. Everything that was wrong seemed impossible to fix. With every mistake, embarrassing moment, and failure, the urge to run away grew stronger.</p>
                        <p>I knew that it wasn’t a viable solution. And so, in an effort to temporarily escape my reality, I’d wake up early in the morning and leave for work two hours before I’d need to go in. My workplace was near Meadow Lake of Flushing Meadow Corona Park. Every morning, I’d walk over the overpass on Grand Central Parkway to make my way to the park. I’d watch the moon make way for the sun, the stars disappearing with each ray that broke the night sky. I would hear the birds wake up and chirp their morning song as they welcomed the sun and new day. I’d watch the trees wake up and dance in the wind as their leaves rustled. I’d take solace in the cool, winter breeze and the fresh air as I walked along the water. </p>
                        <p>In those moments, I felt peace and comfort as the open landscape welcomed me, inviting me to explore more of its beauty. I’d feel a sense of hope that just as dark turns into light everyday, maybe one day my sun would shine, too.</p>
