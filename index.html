                        <h4>The inspiration for issue one of Confluence64</h4>
                        <p>Hello reader! I hope you are fine and dandy! Welcome to Confluence64! A zine by yours truly, Carson Snow (that's me!) The idea for Confluence64 came to me in November of 2022 on Thanksgiving Day. My sister was working, and my parents had a dinner planned with some of their friends. To entertain myself, I started rummaging through my stuff and came across the postcard you see below (without the writing, that came afterwards.) I had bought this postcard in a shop on Bainbridge Island in Washington State back in February of 2022 with the intention of giving it to a friend of mine. I had forgotten to, and in all honesty, had forgotten about the postcard all together, until I came across it that night.</p>
                        <p>I started thinking about how the year was coming to an end in a matter of weeks. I began recounting all that had happened since August of 2021 (yes, I am aware that the new year starts in the month of January. However, the story of 2022 wouldn't be complete without the acknowledging the events that occurred in the fall of 2021). It was a tumultuous journey. 2022 will be remembered as one of the more defining years of my life. I experienced many new things and gained great memories. At the same time, those memories were being overcast by the rougher periods of my year.</p>
                        <p>I recognized that I wasn't going to be able to start 2023 on the right foot if I didn't allow myself to process everything that happened over the past year. I wouldn't be able to experience joy if I didn't acknowledge the pain I've held onto. I wouldn't be able to experience growth if I didn't lower my ego and recognize my flaws. I wouldn't be able to feel confidence in myself if I didn't forgive myself. I wouldn't be able to live freely until I saw myself as someone worthy of doing so.</p>
                        <p>And so, I picked up the postcard and a pencil and started drawing in an effort to capture the key moments of the last year. I opened YouTube and Spotify and started listening to the music that was most played during those time periods to travel back to specific moments and memories that were near and dear to me. And little by little, as I opened my mind and heart, I was reliving the defining moments of the past year. Through this experience, I was able to acknowledge the pain and the reasons behind it. I was able to be critical of myself and see where I was in the wrong. I was able to be gentler on myself as I recalled moments where I felt small and was harsh on myself rather than providing grace. I was able to be proud of myself for making it through all that in one piece. I was able to feel happiness for the many good memories that were made despite the chaos that was happening.</p>
                        <p>This zine would have been more complete if I had the journal that I kept during this time. Unfortunately, I had thrown it out in a garbage can on the Brooklyn Bridge. That was a dumb decision. However, it provides me the opportunity to write these memories from a more reflective stance, some even from a more positive one.</p>
                        <p>When I started this zine, I never had any intention of sharing it with anyone. I started working on it to cope with some strong feelings I was experiencing at the time. The reason that I decided to share it upon its completion is because I recognize that I’m not the only one who feels like life is one, big sticky mess. Something that I’ve come to realize is that those sticky situations play an important part in our development and defining the trajectory of our life. In hindsight, those sticky situations are what differentiates between just existing versus living. I hope that my journey and this zine helps provide some validation, support, inspiration, and/or joy for anyone experiencing the highs and lows of life.</p>
                        <p>With love,</p>
                        <p>Carson Snow</p>

                        <p class = "OGMemories">And at this point, the conversation had moved to the form of texts.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>On September 1st, after coping with the death of a family-friend and navigating life with a stupid ass neighbor, I was looking forward to meeting up with LA for lunch. I was surprised he had suggested the idea of meeting up for food because we didn’t talk much aside from the basic good morning greeting when he’d pass by my desk to put his lunchbox in the fridge. That was the first thing that stood out - the lunchboxes. They were always bright and colorful, like the green turtle ninja one, which is the one that stood out most. I found it whimsical. It made him seem approachable, and to me, showed that he had a carefree persona. We made plans to meet up at Station House.</p>
                        <p>Side note: At the time of writing this memory, it is February 2023. Almost three years since the world completely shut down because of the COVID-19 pandemic. I graduated the spring before in May of 2019. I wasn’t a social butterfly pre-pandemic. Ever since I was little, I struggled with making friends. Some of it was because I was a shy kid, some of it because I was bullied for my appearance. Since I didn’t have a lot of friends in school, I would put all my focus towards doing well in my classes and work. When I graduated from college, I had the realization that I missed out on the opportunity of enjoying my youth and making memories with peers who were my age. I made a few goals for myself post-graduation.</p>
                        <ol><li>Socialize more, meet new people, try to make friends.</li><li>Go out more. Home, school, work, occasional outing with the family. My world consisted of only these three places. Any outing (like going to Canada to visit family) was done with my family. The world outside of my home and family was completely unknown to me. At 21 years old, the curiosity was finally catching up. I would need to leave home to find out what was other there.</li><li>Learn to be comfortable and confident with myself. My biggest flaw is that I am a people-pleaser. I filter many parts of myself so that I can be accepted by the people in my life, so that people don’t leave me. I kept filtering and filtering and got to the point where I didn’t really have a personality anymore. I wanted to find the real me and reconnect with who she was.</li></ol>
                        <p>Fall of 2019 was chaotic. I left my first job for a variety of reasons, some related to the job itself, some not. I tried really hard to stay but ultimately decided it wasn’t worth it. I was constantly wishing that I would get into an accident on my way to work so I wouldn’t have to go. I started binge eating and gained a lot of weight in a short amount of time. The pandemic followed shortly after and the goals I had made for myself post-graduation didn’t pan out. Thankfully, I was gainfully employed throughout the pandemic. Even though I was at home with my family, it was a unique experience. I was grateful we were together and healthy, but I felt very smothered at times - that sums up 2020. The summer of 2021 was a shitty one as we had squatters move into the apartment below us and they were adamant on making us move out for some reason. Turns out it wasn’t their first time doing this and it’s all part of their scheme - they don’t pay rent, harass the neighbors living with them, and then as soon as the neighbors move, they leave as well. On top of this, someone who was just like family to us passed away suddenly and the world turned upside down. It was surreal. It was the second death I had experienced, the first being my younger brother when I was seven years old. I visit his grave every now and then to clean it up. The graves around him are babies and toddlers, too. I’ll clean them up a little bit as well.</p>
                        <p>I was really excited about meeting up with LA at Station House. We were returning to somewhat of a “normal” state of life which meant that I could introduce the goal of socializing again. We sat by the window at a high table that had bar stools as the seat. I remember thinking how awkward the act of seating yourself on a barstool is. You’re climbing up to sit down. It’s hard to adjust your seat closer to the table once seated because your feet don’t reach the ground. Then you have to get down, move the seat closer, and shimmy back up again. Sometimes the seat was taken too close to the table and then you have to repeat the process again.</p>
                        <p>I don’t remember the conversation all too well. I do remember he had interesting things to share, more interesting than anything I could have offered to the conversation. He likes to travel, he sells clothes, he graduated from college early and started teaching at a young age, he already finished his master’s and is tenured. I didn’t really look at him all too well up until this point. He was handsome and well-dressed with a unique sense of style. He had big, green eyes that shined like the ocean on sunny day. You could tell that he looked similar with or without facial hair, which is a good trait to have. Some people look like a completely different person when they shave - not bad, just different. He had a really nice smile - it embodied a strong confidence, but also humility and kindness. He was a good listener and maintained eye contact with whoever he was talking to.</p>
                        <p>It was nice to be able to take a step back and do some thing new. I was excited about fostering new friendships. It’s funny how people come into your life. What are the chances that two people cross paths and become a part of each other’s life in any capacity? Everyday we interact with so many people, yet only some become important parts of our lives. The ones that make a difference in your life, those are miracles. September 1st marks the beginning of a friendship. Finally, a friend.</p>

                        <p></p>
                        <p></p>

                        <h4>Akino</h4>
                        <p>Note to self - take the subway when visiting Elmhurst. I had been driving for almost an hour and had yet to find parking. The issue wasn’t that there was zero parking available, though parking is limited in this neighborhood. The problem was that almost every parking spot that I encountered required me to parallel park. It’s not that I can’t parallel park, but it’s hard to parallel park when there is so much traffic. And you could only hold up traffic in a one way for so long before you had to move on.</p>
                        <p>Eventually, I found a parking spot farther away from the place - a good 10 to 15 minute walk. Honestly, not bad. I was about to give up and go home. I had lost all hope of finding parking. There was an oddly high amount of empty spaces which made me feel like there was a high chance of coming back to either a) a parking ticket or b) a towed car. But, I took my chances and started walking to the restaurant.</p>
                        <p>Not only was I late, but it also meant that I’d be walking in to everyone there already, which made me nervous. If I was early or on time, I’d be walking in with other people which was less nerve wrecking. However, now I’m entering on my own. And if I needed to squeeze through to sit somewhere because all the easier to sit in seats (seats on the corner, seats facing aisles) are taken, I think I might die internally. Sometimes the squeeze is tight and I end up feeling like an ogre because I’m barely making it through. My worst fear is that the day will come where my butt and thighs are too big to squeeze through and I get stuck.</p>
                        <p>I don’t recall if this was my second or third time going out with a larger group of people. It was nice to be invited to things - that wasn’t something that happened often. I was struggling with this new territory and experience, though. Every time I went out, I would look around and observe everyone else. Everyone always looked great. Youthful, bright, and vibrant. Enjoying their food, enjoying each others company, conversing with such ease. I felt out of place in comparison. I was worried about making sure I was acting normal and not doing anything that was awkward. Looking back, if I had attempted to breathe, loosen up, and get out of my head, it would have been better. I was thinking about all the wrong things. As I stated earlier, I struggled with binge eating and gained weight. I was struggling with feeling confident in myself. I’d be thinking about how big my thighs looked when sitting in the chair, whether people think I’m too fat to be ordering certain things, and making sure not to eat too much or too fast so that I’m not the first one to finish.</p>
                        <p>While I was nervous, I was also excited about these social experiences. At around this point of fall 2021, I had dropped out of my master’s program. I was having trouble managing work, school, and the extreme fatigue that I was experiencing. I was passing out on the stairs when I’d come home from work or school. I’d later learn that I was extremely iron deficient. Who would have thought a mineral could cause so much havoc? It wasn’t an ideal decision. I already was starting later than I had intended. I took a gap year after graduating in 2019. Then, COVID happened so I decided 2020 wasn’t the best time to start. I felt like such a failure. But, at least I had something fun to look towards in the midst of all this.</p>
                        <p>Thankfully the seat was a corner seat so I saved myself the awkwardness of having to shimmy through to squeeze in somewhere. But, the seat was across from LA and I knew I looked ugly as fuck, so that sucked ass. He looked great, but when didn’t he.</p>
                        <p>To make matters worse, everyone ordered already. What made that bad was that I didn’t know anything about sushi or Japanese cuisine as I never had it before. This was my first time. Growing up, my family and I would go to a handful of restaurants, but usually did take out and ate at home. So, while NYC has an amazing food scene, I have not even experienced a fraction of it because it wasn’t something that I was aware of. Since a buffet was ordered, I decided the best course of action was to try the food ordered for that. You can imagine my horror when most of the food ordered was raw fish. I tried a few pieces but it honestly wasn’t my cup of tea. Makes me think why is it easier to eat certain animals like chicken and turkey, but harder to digest (mentally and physically) things like raw fish? What in our mind makes one meat more “acceptable” to eat and others revolting at the thought of it? I don’t have an answer to this, but raw fish was a loss.</p>
                        <p>I ended up ordering some fries. No disrespect to Akino, but the fries were not good. Sushi is their expertise for sure. The fries were most definitely the frozen shoestring variety that can be found at grocery stores. I remember that we were struggling with finishing the items ordered from the buffet. Initially, I didn’t think it was a big deal. What’s the problem in leaving food that we were unable to finish? Couldn’t we just doggy bag it? I later learned that we would be charged extra for any wasted food. It was quite comical. Reminded me of that Drake and Josh episode where they were rushing to pack sushi. Except, instead of packing sushi, we were rushing to eat it, hide it, spreading it out across plates to make it look like crumbs. The night ended with dessert. I had red bean ice cream. It’s a very pretty color, but it tasted like vanilla ice cream to me so I’m not really sure if the purpose of the bean was to add natural color or if there was supposed to be an added flavor. But what do I know, I’m not a food critic.</p>
                        <p>Thankfully my car was still there and I did not receive a parking ticket. Despite how awkward I felt through the night, it was a change from how most of my nights were - at home watching tv. And he walked me to my car which was nice of him. I had to drive him back though since I had parked far from the restaurant. He sort of disappeared the second half of the night. I later learned that he had stepped out with another girl. I’m not going to lie, I kind of felt a little jealous. I never felt jealousy, but that day I did. I don’t like that feeling, it’s really icky. The reality was that he was way too out of my league in any capacity, romantic or platonic.</p>

                        <p></p>

                        <h4>Meadow Lake</h4>
                        <p>I remember watching a VSauce video on <a href="https://youtu.be/CPBJgpK0Ulc">how people disappear</a> 10 years ago. In the video he mentions in most jurisdictions, if someone is missing and isn’t found, after 5-7 years they are declared “dead in absentia.”</p>
                        <p>It got me thinking about the question of how does one go missing on their own accord? How does one just disappear and start a new life far away? I remember thinking it’s easier to run away and start over if you were on your own to begin with (i.e. no family or friends who would want to look for you). They would need to live on only cash because if they use their cards they would be found through their transaction history. In regards to shelter, their best bet would be living in an RV. The only problem is that maintenance would be expensive. A car would be cheaper, but then storage, cooking, and bathrooms pose potential issues. Bathrooms especially because I hate public bathrooms. For work they would need to work off the books because where would they put their checks? Not their bank account, then they’ll be found. Then came things that were more difficult to resolve, such as the issue of internet for your computer. You can’t have an internet service if you live in a vehicle - routers involve wiring and stuff. You could utilize hotspot, but that involves having a cell phone which could be used to find you. And how do you sign up for a cell phone plan without using your real identity? And then the fact that it is scary to be alone. What if you hear something or see something in the middle of the night? It’s only you and there is no comfort in that. After racking my brain and growing tired of coming up with solutions and alternatives to live your fullest life in hiding, I moved on because it really didn’t matter to 15 year old me.</p>
                        <p>Except it mattered to 23 year old me. Every waking moment I would think about leaving everyone and everything. I would think about going somewhere new and starting over every single day. I was overwhelmed by my job. I felt like a failure for dropping out of all my classes. I was tired all the time. I constantly felt like I had the wind knocked out of me. I’d know, it happened once when I was 9 years old. My neighbor, who was older the me, got mad at me for touching his football. He socked me right in the stomach. I felt like that constantly. I hated that none of the pieces in my life were fitting. It’s like I was trying to put together a puzzle with pieces that were all from a different set. I was tired of my life and I was tired of myself. I hated myself. I was disgusted by myself. Everything that was wrong seemed impossible to fix. With every mistake, embarrassing moment, and failure, the urge to run away grew stronger.</p>
                        <p>I knew that it wasn’t a viable solution. And so, in an effort to temporarily escape my reality, I’d wake up early in the morning and leave for work two hours before I’d need to go in. My workplace was near Meadow Lake of Flushing Meadow Corona Park. Every morning, I’d walk over the overpass on Grand Central Parkway to make my way to the park. I’d watch the moon make way for the sun, the stars disappearing with each ray that broke the night sky. I would hear the birds wake up and chirp their morning song as they welcomed the sun and new day. I’d watch the trees wake up and dance in the wind as their leaves rustled. I’d take solace in the cool, winter breeze and the fresh air as I walked along the water. </p>
                        <p>In those moments, I felt peace and comfort as the open landscape welcomed me, inviting me to explore more of its beauty. I’d feel a sense of hope that just as dark turns into light everyday, maybe one day my sun would shine, too.</p>

                        <p class = "OGMemories">Note taken on my phone on 01/17/2022:</p>  
                        <p class = "OGMemories">A night in a world Heather McHugh</p>    
                        <p class = "OGMemories">I wouldn't have known if I didn't stay home</p>

                        <p class = "OGMemories">and again: one mountain ash.</p>  
                        <p></p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p class = "OGMemories">And I wouldn't have thought, without traveling out</p>  
                        <p class = "OGMemories">how huge that dipper was.</p>  
                        <p class = "OGMemories">how small that tree.</p>  
                        <p></p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>You know when things spiral so out of control, you can’t even pinpoint the exact moment that it all started. Like there is no defining moment. It was just a whole bunch of little moments. A slow progression if you will. Staples, fingernails, safety pins, nothing too blunt because the intent wasn’t to depart physically, just to release myself emotionally. I felt lighter afterwards, but it wouldn’t last long. In the long run, I just felt heavier in every aspect. Bad habit number one.</p>
                        <p>Weekends consisted of me going out and biking until sundown. Don’t take this as me being very athletic. I was riding the Citi e-bikes and those things fly like the wind. The e-assist is no joke. Funny story about the Citi e-bikes: I had accidentally purchased a yearly pass sometime around this time. I called customer service and they kindly cancelled the pass and provided me with a refund. However, the annual pass benefits were still actively working because the total charge for my rides was very low compared to what I was paying before. I guess it was kismat because those weekend bike rides were the only thing I looked forward to, in addition to my morning sunrise walks. A normal Saturday routine involved taking the train to Vernon-Jackson Blvd. From there, I’d take a bike and ride over the Pulaski Bridge. I would ride past the Williamsburg Bridge all the way to Brooklyn Heights. Then, I’d turn around and make my way back.</p>
                        <p>On days where I didn’t feel like riding the bike back to Vernon-Jackson, I’d catch the M train to El Metro and walk to take the F from Forest Hills because the bus service was spotty during weekends. Yeah, I could wait for the bus. But, standing in one place for 20 minutes is kind of boring. I’d start walking along the bus route and make progress towards my destination. I’d check my phone to see how far back the bus was and if I’d get too tried, I’d stop at the next bus stop to catch it. I enjoyed those walks. Middle Village is a quaint neighborhood, and I enjoyed exploring different neighborhoods in Queens.</p>
                        <p>Some weekends I would walk around Forest Park, hiking on the trails. The trails at Forest Park are really nice. It’s hard to believe you’re even in the city. They are quite expansive, I don’t think I’ve ever walked the entirety of them. I loved those trails. They gave me lovely hugs on days where I felt no love. At some point, I started alternating my morning walks before work between Forest Park and Meadow Lake.</p>
                        <p>Winter is my favorite season for going outside. It’s cold so you don’t get sweaty. There are no bugs. There’s not a lot of people out since it’s cold. However, all of the above was bad habit number two. I would spend almost the whole day outside. I wasn’t really too productive and spending all day out wasn’t really helping with that. A lot of the things I should have been doing were hitting the back burner. But, I believe I had really just given up trying. I think deep down I was hoping I’d be gone soon enough, so none of it would really matter anyway.</p>
                        <p>There was something else that prompted me going out for the entire day during the weekends. As the world started opening back up from the pandemic, my own world was too. I realized how different I was from people my age:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I wasn’t the most social and lacked friendships with people who were my age - and it showed because I struggled with social interactions. Maybe it wasn’t too obvious on the outside, but on the inside, I was struggling. </li>
                            <li>I have never been in a relationship or even dated because it wasn’t encouraged. During college, there were some guys who would ask me out, but I always said no because I knew my parents wouldn’t be happy about it. It sucked because I really wanted to, but I would sheepishly say “I would love to but I’m just so busy with school and work.”</li>
                            <li>I had just started going out on the weekends and socializing with other people, but it was met with resistance at home. My parents weren’t too happy about it and I wasn’t really able to enjoy myself fully because I’d have to be home by a certain time. Which was another thing I realized - most people my age don’t have curfews.</li>
                            <li>As I became more social, I was constantly told that I needed to be careful. That friends come and go. They are backstabbers waiting for an opportunity to screw you over. That they don’t actually like me and will leave me. That they won’t be there for you and that I’ll be left out to hang dry, only to come crawling back home. It made socializing even more stressful because in the back of my head, I always worried that these people that I considered my friends actually hated me.</li>
                            <li>I was feeling resentful about something that occurred a few years earlier. I wanted to move to Washington State after graduation in 2019. I had a job offer, too - a job with city government. But, I couldn’t go because my mother said I would get too sad on my own. That I’d miss her and she would miss me. It was true, I would have missed her a lot. I wish I had gone though because it was something I really wanted - to move out of New York City.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I love my parents and I know they love me, too. I know that these limitations were placed out of love. They don’t want to see me get hurt or throw away my potential. At the age of 24, though, I wanted to be able to live life more freely. The more I tried to do so, the more I was viewed as a good girl gone bad in my parents eyes. I started feeling smothered by my own life. All the opportunities, experiences, and memories I missed. What if Seattle would have been the best thing that would have happened to me? What if I missed out on meeting the love of my life? What if I’m never able to make friends now because it is so much harder to as an adult? Add the stress from work and I started drawing lines on my arms to cope with all these feelings.</p>
                        <p>I started therapy around mid January . LA saw my arms and asked about them. He helped me find a therapist and even went with me to the first session. I was embarrassed that he noticed.  No one else did. In all honesty, I think I wanted someone to notice. I was struggling and was starting to feel isolated. I didn’t know how to help myself and was hoping that someone would.</p>
                        <p>Looking back, that was wrong of me. To put pressure on someone else to fix me without doing any of the work myself. Please don’t take the people who help you for granted. People don’t need to help you. They aren’t obligated to. To put the pressure on someone is unfair and taking advantage of their kindness. It’s easy to think you’re the only one down in the dumps, but everyone is dealing with their own shit. For someone to take on someone else’s shit in addition to their own is the realist form of an angel that will ever be encountered. You’re just dealing with your own singular shit. They have double the shit - a shitstorm.</p>
                        <p>Therapy was helpful. My therapist really helped me through the shit. That first session, all I did was cry. I wasn’t able to say anything articulate - every time I’d try, I would just cry more. I really looked forward to Wednesday afternoons. I started keeping a journal at the end of December. That journal was my companion, my best friend. It knew all my secrets. Between therapy and my journal, I was able to stop myself from sinking completely. Of course, until I learned later that my mother was snooping through my stuff. I protected that journal like my life depended on it.</p>
                        <p>It was through therapy that I went on my first ever solo trip to Seattle. And, embarrassingly confessed my feelings for him. And, left my old job because it was ruining me. And, tried to move out. It was through therapy that I realized that love shouldn’t be overbearing. And it shouldn’t be conditional. I realized how much that love limited my chance to see the world. I had stayed home and was never able to see how large the Big Dipper is.</p>
                        <p>Thanks to him, I was able to get the help needed to step out and see a whole new world. And thanks to my therapist, I felt heard for the first time in a long time. She was my anchor and keep me from getting lost at sea. She saved my life.</p>

                        <h4>Brooklyn Steele </h4>
                        <p>My first concert that I attended was on February 12, 2022. It was a Lupe Fiasco concert. I’ve never heard of Lupe Fiasco until the days leading up to the concert. Side note - he is at MIT as a fellow for the 2022-2023 academic year and you can find his lectures on MIT’s YouTube page. Definitely worth checking out.</p>
                        <p>I digress. I bought the tickets to his concert from a coworker on February 9th for $50. There were a few reasons that prompted this impromptu decision. The first is that I wanted to see a concert and apparently Lupe Fiasco is a good first concert to see. I listened to his Food and Liquor album the days leading up to February 12, and am glad that I made the impromptu decision to go. That whole album is really good. His work is poetry. I would melt if someone sang “Sunshine” to me.</p>
                        <p>The second reason was that I wanted to start breaking out of my mold. I was tired of seeing life go by and not doing anything to experience it. I wanted to go out, socialize, and fit in with other people my age. In an effort to experience these things, I would hop on any opportunities that would arise. So, when I heard that LA and some of his friends were going to this concert, I decided to join as well.</p>
                        <p>They couldn’t understand why all of a sudden I wanted to do these things that I never did before, which would lead to conflict often. Maybe I didn’t do these things because deep down I knew it made my parents happy to know their kid wasn’t a screw up like those of their friends. I want to preface by saying I don’t believe any of those kids are screw ups. I honestly envied them growing up - how brave they were to do the things they wanted to do and to be the person they wanted to be. While I on the other hand constantly denied myself the opportunity to do many things that I wish I had - dating (oh, all the handsome fellows that I had to let down with the lame excuse of “I’m busy with school and work”), going out with friends, doing study abroad, moving to Seattle after graduating with my bachelor’s, and the list goes on. All to keep a pristine and clean image. All to ensure that my parents were always proud of me. Ultimately, it became a personality trait and I’ve denied myself from doing so many things for so long, that it didn’t really even bother me anymore.</p>
                        <p>I started seeing all the experiences that other people my age were having. I wanted to live the lives they were living. A life of color and excitement. Doing so meant staining the clean image I had curated which made my parents upset. They saw this as a divide between our relationship. My mother would tell me to be careful because I’m treading dangerous waters - these people that I consider my friends would leave me hanging out to dry soon enough, and I’ll eventually find myself crawling back to her. That the only people who would ever stick by you is your family, no one else has any reason to do so.</p>
                        <p>I know that reading this, you may think “well, you’re an adult, just do what you want” or “that’s quite the overreaction.” Both are valid points. I am an adult and I have the free will to do what I want to do. However, I also want to be respectful of my parents because I know that ultimately what comes off as overbearing is their love and concern for me.</p>
                        <p>During my birth there were complications. My mom didn’t go to the hospital during her pregnancy with me until the day of my birth. My dad had to decide who the doctors should save - my mom or me. Luckily we both survived. But, the beginning of my existence started at the cusp of life and death. As a result my parents are very protective of me. I have a younger sister. My parents love us both dearly. However, I’d be lying if I didn’t say that the love they have for me is different than that for my sister. I think it has to do with me being their first kid and being born in these extraordinary circumstances. My dad always gleams when he tells me that on the day of my birth, all the doctors said I was the most beautiful baby born that day. Head full of hair, chubby and rosy cheeks, skin that shined like fresh, white snow. I was a smart kid, too. My parents were so proud that they were able to produce a kid who had a bright future ahead of her.</p>
                        <p>All they saw now was their beautiful girl doing ugly things that threatened the bright future ahead of her.</p>
                        <p>Going to this concert was an opportunity for me to expand the limitations that existed because of the protectiveness of my parents. As well as the limitations I had set on myself. The more limitations I tested, the more upset my parents would get. I wasn’t the same person to them anymore. It felt like with each boundary I tested, the less love they had for me. The distance between us was growing little by little each day.</p>
                        <p>The concert was really awesome. At this point, there was another person who I grew closer to. We’ll call him BR. You’ll see in later memories that he was the GOAT. Also, Lupe Fiasco is one fine looking gentleman. Unfortunately, I only got to list to three songs before I had to head out. I had to be home by 10 pm otherwise my parents would have been unhappy. I hated that, but I didn’t want to drive the distance between us any farther.</p>
                        <p class = "OGMemories">From my planner - Saturday, February 12th, Lupe Fiasco concert with LA and BR</p>

                        <h4>Seattle</h4>
                        <p>My flight to Seattle was on February 18th, 2022. It was my first solo trip. Originally, I had wanted to go to San Francisco, but my mother was against it because it would involve me having to stay at a hotel since she didn’t know anyone there who could host me. I actually made the tickets to San Francisco and booked a hotel room, too. Ultimately, I had to cancel the tickets and hotel reservation because my mother wasn’t happy. I picked Seattle because it was another city I was interested in visiting and we had some family-friends who would host me for the week, which made my mother comfortable with me traveling on my own.</p>
                        <p>On the flight I sat next to this Polish woman in her 50s. Her name was Victoria and she was traveling to Alaska. I was sitting in the aisle seat, Victoria was in the middle seat, and another lady by the window seat. At first Victoria tried to make conversation with the lady by the window seat. The lady had her headphones in and did not reciprocate. Then, Victoria turned to me. I didn’t feel like talking, but felt it wouldn’t have been nice to ignore her. Unfortunately, I did not have any headphones in, so I was unable to pretend I didn’t hear her.</p>
                        <p>Victoria asked me where I was traveling to and I told her I was going to Seattle. She was nanny by day, cleaner by night. She was taking the week off to go on vacation to Alaska. She would be meeting up with a group of tourists and go sightseeing and stuff like that.</p>
                        <p>A little bit into the flight refreshments were offered. Victoria helped herself to some alcohol. She started talking about how her first husband was a dick. He wouldn’t work and would take her money. He was also an alcoholic and had anger issues. She ended up leaving him and remarrying. Then she talked about how the girl she nannies for is really clever, but the mom gets concerned because the girl is more attached to Victoria than her own mother.</p>
                        <p>She was very eccentric. Sometimes it was hard to understand her because of her accent, so I would just smile and nod. I had to be careful because sometimes she was actually angry when recounting stories of her past and I’d have to make a facial expression that matched. It would be weird for me to smile if she was actually angry about something.</p>
                        <p>I pretended to doze off so I could take a breather from our conversation. A second round of refreshments came around. While I was pretending to be asleep, Victoria told the flight attendant if she could get another soda so that she could give it to me when I woke up, as well as a pack of cookies. Victoria is a good soul who wears her heart on her sleeve.</p>
                        <p>We said our goodbyes when the flight landed and I made my way to find our family-friends who would host me for the week. I was nervous because I had only met them a couple times before this. They were a married couple in their late 30s. They had a son and a daughter who were in elementary school. They were really great hosts. I really enjoyed their company and was sad to leave them when my trip came to an end.</p>
                        <p>Seattle is a small city. I was able to see most of it in the first two to three days. I didn’t really do any proper planning for this trip in terms of sightseeing and things to do. My first day started with a ride on the Great Wheel and had pancakes for breakfast nearby. After breakfast I explored Pike Place which was a lot of fun. It’s very much like a maze and there were a lot of neat markets and shops. Next, I went on the Underground Seattle Tour which I highly recommend. The history of Seattle is a funny one. In short, it was a city that was build on literal shit. Then, the whole town burned down. No deaths, but a clean slate to start all over, this time without the shit. We got to see the original work that was done to build the plumbing system, and the history behind it. The tour guide was a great storyteller. Afterwards, I took the ferry to Bainbridge. I didn’t stay for too long though because I wanted to be able to catch the ferry back.</p>
                        <p>The days following were just as unplanned as the first day. I went to the Space Needle. There I met another tourist from New York City. He worked for the Board of Elections and had taken the week off to visit Seattle with his friend. I went to a dive bar nearby. The food was okay. The pie was really cold and stale. Food in New York City is better. On this day, I actually tried out the e-bikes in Seattle. They didn’t have pedals and relied on the handles to accelerate and move. There are a lot of hills in Seattle so at one point I had to get off the e-bike and push it up the hill. In an attempt to speed up the process, I decided to accelerate the bike using the handles. What followed was the bike getting out of control, flipping out of my hands, and both me and the bike falling on the curb. Don’t do this, it is a very dumb thing to do.</p>
                        <p>The day before my last day I went back to Bainbridge and went o a boutique toy shop where I had bought some more stuffed animals, as well as the post card that I eventually drew my first sketch of this zine on. Those stuffed animals were the most perfect stuffed animals I’ve ever seen. They were so homey and nostalgic.</p>
                        <p>My last day was the perfect day. The sky was blue, the sun was shining, and there was not a cloud in sight. Seattle was kind to me because it only rained one day during my visit. I took the train to Angle Lake and enjoyed the peace, quiet, and fresh air. Afterwards, I took the train to Seattle one last time. I had breakfast by The Great Wheel, took the e-bike around the city, and ventured to Pike Place. I enjoyed the space I had away from home. I enjoyed being on my own and not having to worry about upsetting anyone or walking on eggshells or any of that. I was able to go out wherever I wanted and come back whenever I wanted and not worry that I was out for too long or didn’t come back in time. I was glad to have a break from work and not worry about the never ending workload, students, or my boss. I should have been lesson planning but gave up after my third day on break because I really just needed a breather. My last stop on my way back to my host’s home was Colombia City. I stopped by at a vintage toy store and bought myself another teddy bear, as well as stuffed animals, candy, and coloring books for my host’s kids as a goodbye present. I bought some more coffee beans for him at a local coffee shop nearby.</p>
                        <p>At this point in time, I had developed really strong feelings for him. I was in love with him. He was everything I wanted to be as a person - determined, motivated, kind, funny, stylish, and smart. I had a lot of trust in him. I usually am not vulnerable with people, but I felt comfortable being vulnerable with him because he helped me get help when he saw my arms. He reacted so calmly and with so much patience and grace. The thing is that I knew he wasn’t going to feel the same way about me. I definitely was not his type. And I wasn’t really even sure if he saw me as a solid friend, let alone a possible romantic interested.</p>
                        <p>When I came back from Seattle, I went to his place to drop off the coffee beans. I could have waited until the following week, but I was just looking for an excuse to see him sooner than that. I wonder if my feelings for him were obvious to him, because that would be embarrassing if that were the case.</p>

                        <h4>Beacon</h4>
                        <p>Work was shit. Work was shit. It was so shit, I have to type it twice. I was really giving it by best. However, my best was not enough and I bombed my formal evaluation in April. At some point after the Seattle trip, I didn't really care anymore about giving my best. I guess I started "quiet quitting." This was my third year of teaching at this point. During my Seattle trip, I had starting playing with the idea of leaving after the end of the school year. At first, I thought about transferring schools. But, I was so jaded by teaching that I opened up to the idea of leaving teaching all together.</p>
                        <p>It wasn't an easy decision to come to. It was actually a really painful realization. This was my dream since I was five years old. And for the past three years, I had been watching my dream crumble and fall apart. I was watching it die. I kept forcing myself to fit into something that wasn't the right fit because it was all I ever wanted, it was too hard to let go, and the thought of leaving seemed tougher than the thought of staying. However, it was stupid to do that. It isn't fair to my employer, to the students, to my colleagues, or to myself. I owed it to them to leave so they could find someone who wants to be there. I owed it to myself to find something that didn't make me miserable.</p>
                        <p>On April 29th, I decided that I was going to take a mental health day and go on a day trip upstate to breathe and think about next steps. I didn't tell my family because we weren't really speaking each other much anymore. I pretended to go to work, dropped my stuff of at his house so I wasn't being weighed down by it, and made my way to Grand Central Terminal to take the MetroNorth to Beacon. The decision to go to Beacon wasn't guided by anything other than the fact that I saw many tourist buying tickets to Beacon. I've never been on the MetroNorth or upstate, so I figured it was a good idea to go somewhere a lot of people go to.</p>
                        <p>It was good to go upstate. I finalized my decision and started applying for jobs when I came back. Even though it was going to hurt like hell, I decided that I was going to leave teaching. It'll always be there, and I owed it to myself to find something that wasn't stressing me out or making me feel anxious all the time. Maybe one day when I'm better mentally and emotionally, and am more mature, I could return to teaching.</p>
                        <p>I also came to another decision, a very foolish one at that. I decided that I was going to confess my feelings for him. I figured that the "what if?" game was stupid; let me just put it out there. Worst case is he doesn't feel the same way and since we are both pleasant people, we could move and continue being friends. Best case is he does feel the same way which would open up another can of worms - I've never been in a relationship before. But, I figured if it did work out, there is no one else I would want my first relationship to be with.</p>
                        <p>I remember the day I told him. It was April 30th and it was raining. I had gone out to do laundry and was playing around in the Notes app of my phone, writing down what I would say when I would call him. I finally mustered the courage to call him up. I was sitting in my car waiting for the clothes to dry. He answered and I started feeling really sick to my stomach. But, I wasn’t going to back out now. The pre-written notes were of no help because I didn’t even bother looking at them. I blacked out and after stumbling on my words, I spit it out. He didn't feel the same way. I played it off as it being no biggie. But, I was a little sad that it was the case.</p>
                        <p>Side story: I signed up for Hinge at his suggestion shortly before I confessed my feels for him. I went on one date, if you can even call it that. I met up with the man and we went to the Empire State Building since he's never been there. He was from Connecticut and was staying on Long Island for a couple of months since he was an assistant on set for a Netflix show. It ended up with me being more a tour guide. He wanted to get food afterwards but I just wanted to go home. I was just about to leave until he said that he doesn't know how to get back to where he parked his car. I was stuck with him for another 40 minutes as we took the train back to Queens. I video chatted with some other people I matched with. But, it didn't feel right. Nothing about this app felt organic or meaningful. So, I deleted the app. End of side story.</p>
                        <p>On May 2nd, I took the day off work. I was too embarrassed to face him. This time, I ate breakfast at Georgia Diner and took the LIRR to Port Washington. They have a nice library there and it has a fantastic view of the town. He and I continued to be friends after my confession. I was glad that the "what if" was answered and that I could see him for what he really is - a really good friend.</p>
