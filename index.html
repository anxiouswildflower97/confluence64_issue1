                        <h4>The inspiration for issue one of Confluence64</h4>
                        <p>Hello reader! I hope you are fine and dandy! Welcome to Confluence64! A zine by yours truly, Carson Snow (that's me!) The idea for Confluence64 came to me in November of 2022 on Thanksgiving Day. My sister was working, and my parents had a dinner planned with some of their friends. To entertain myself, I started rummaging through my stuff and came across the postcard you see below (without the writing, that came afterwards.) I had bought this postcard in a shop on Bainbridge Island in Washington State back in February of 2022 with the intention of giving it to a friend of mine. I had forgotten to, and in all honesty, had forgotten about the postcard all together, until I came across it that night.</p>
                        <p>I started thinking about how the year was coming to an end in a matter of weeks. I began recounting all that had happened since August of 2021 (yes, I am aware that the new year starts in the month of January. However, the story of 2022 wouldn't be complete without the acknowledging the events that occurred in the fall of 2021). It was a tumultuous journey. 2022 will be remembered as one of the more defining years of my life. I experienced many new things and gained great memories. At the same time, those memories were being overcast by the rougher periods of my year.</p>
                        <p>I recognized that I wasn't going to be able to start 2023 on the right foot if I didn't allow myself to process everything that happened over the past year. I wouldn't be able to experience joy if I didn't acknowledge the pain I've held onto. I wouldn't be able to experience growth if I didn't lower my ego and recognize my flaws. I wouldn't be able to feel confidence in myself if I didn't forgive myself. I wouldn't be able to live freely until I saw myself as someone worthy of doing so.</p>
                        <p>And so, I picked up the postcard and a pencil and started drawing in an effort to capture the key moments of the last year. I opened YouTube and Spotify and started listening to the music that was most played during those time periods to travel back to specific moments and memories that were near and dear to me. And little by little, as I opened my mind and heart, I was reliving the defining moments of the past year. Through this experience, I was able to acknowledge the pain and the reasons behind it. I was able to be critical of myself and see where I was in the wrong. I was able to be gentler on myself as I recalled moments where I felt small and was harsh on myself rather than providing grace. I was able to be proud of myself for making it through all that in one piece. I was able to feel happiness for the many good memories that were made despite the chaos that was happening.</p>
                        <p>This zine would have been more complete if I had the journal that I kept during this time. Unfortunately, I had thrown it out in a garbage can on the Brooklyn Bridge. That was a dumb decision. However, it provides me the opportunity to write these memories from a more reflective stance, some even from a more positive one.</p>
                        <p>When I started this zine, I never had any intention of sharing it with anyone. I started working on it to cope with some strong feelings I was experiencing at the time. The reason that I decided to share it upon its completion is because I recognize that I’m not the only one who feels like life is one, big sticky mess. Something that I’ve come to realize is that those sticky situations play an important part in our development and defining the trajectory of our life. In hindsight, those sticky situations are what differentiates between just existing versus living. I hope that my journey and this zine helps provide some validation, support, inspiration, and/or joy for anyone experiencing the highs and lows of life.</p>
                        <p>With love,</p>
                        <p>Carson Snow</p>

                        <p></p>
                        <p class = "OGMemories">And at this point, the conversation had moved to the form of texts.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>On September 1st, after coping with the death of a family-friend and navigating life with a dick as a neighbor, I was looking forward to meeting up with LA for lunch. I was surprised he had suggested the idea of meeting up for food because we didn’t talk much aside from the basic good morning greeting when he’d pass by my desk to put his lunchbox in the fridge. That was the first thing that stood out - the lunchboxes. They were always bright and colorful, like the green turtle ninja one, which is the one that stood out most. I found it whimsical. It made him seem approachable, and to me, showed that he had a carefree persona. We made plans to meet at Station House.</p>
                        <p>I was really excited about meeting up with LA at Station House. We were returning to somewhat of a “normal” state of life. I was excited about having the opportunity to be more social, something that I didn’t do much of before. The pandemic made me realize how important connecting with people is and as I was deprived of these connections even prior to the pandemic, I was eager to start making friends. We sat by the window at a high table that had bar stools as the seat. The act of seating yourself on a barstool is awkward. You’re climbing up to sit down. It’s hard to adjust your seat closer to the table once seated because your feet don’t reach the ground. Then you have to get down, move the seat closer, and shimmy back up again. Sometimes the seat was taken too close to the table and then you have to repeat the process again.</p>
                        <p>I don’t remember the conversation all too well. I do remember he had interesting things to share, more interesting than anything I could have offered to the conversation. He likes to travel, he sells clothes, he graduated from college early and started teaching at a young age, he already finished his master’s and is tenured. I didn’t really look at him all too well up until this point. He was kind of cute. He was stylish which made sense as he sold clothes. He had a smile that embodied a strong confidence, but also humility and kindness. He has a very goofy laugh - he laughed like a little kid - it was an honest and genuine laugh. You could tell he was the type of guy who looked good with or without a beard. Some people look like a completely different person when they shave - not bad, just different. He had big green eyes that held a clear sense of direction and determination.</p>
                        <p>It was nice to be able to take a step back from everything that happened that summer and do some thing new. I was excited about fostering new friendships. It’s funny how people come into your life. What are the chances that two people cross paths and become a part of each other’s life in any capacity? Everyday we interact with so many people, yet only some become important parts of our lives. The ones that make a difference in your life, those are miracles. September 1st marks the beginning of a friendship. Finally, a friend.</p>

                        <p></p>
                        <p></p>

                        <h4>Akino</h4>
                        <p>Something important that I learned this night was to never, ever drive into Elmhurst. Parking is a bitch. I drove around for almost an hour and was unable to find any parking. There was some parking available, but they were all required me to parallel park. I know how to parallel park, but it’s hard to do so on busy streets, especially cramped one ways. I was about to give up and go home. Eventually, I found parking about 10 to 15 minutes away from Akino by this grocery store in the backstreets. There was an oddly high amount of empty spaces which made me feel like there was a high chance of coming back to either a) a parking ticket or b) a towed car. But, I took my chances and started walking to the restaurant.</p>
                        <p>At this point of the year, I had dropped out of my master’s program. I wasn’t able to manage working full time, going to school part time, and the constant fatigue simultaneously. I would come home and pass out on the stairs because I was so exhausted. It felt like I had the wind knocked out of me. I later learned it was due to having extremely low iron - crazy that a mineral could cause so much havoc. It wasn’t an ideal decision because I was starting my master’s later that I had intended to. So, these little outings were a nice distraction from my failure.</p>
                        <p>This was my first time eating Japanese food. I’ve never had sushi before in my life before this. An order was made for the buffet and since I didn’t know too much about Japanese cuisine, I figured it would be best for me to participate in the buffet as well. It was mostly raw sushi which was an interesting experience. I wasn’t a big fan of the texture and to be quite honest, I didn’t really taste anything. It just tasted fishy. I ended up ordering some fries instead. No disrespect to Akino, but the fries weren’t good. They were cold and they most definitely were of the frozen shoestring variety that can be found at grocery stores.</p>
                        <p>I remember that we were struggling with finishing the items ordered from the buffet. Initially, I didn’t think it was a big deal. What’s the problem in leaving food that we were unable to finish? Couldn’t we just doggy bag it? Well, we couldn’t, because then we would be charged extra for any wasted food. It was quite comical. Reminded me of that Drake and Josh episode where they were rushing to pack sushi. Except, instead of packing sushi, we were rushing to eat it, hide it, spread it out across plates to make it look like crumbs. The night ended with dessert. I had red bean ice cream. It’s a very pretty color, but it tasted like vanilla ice cream to me so I’m not really sure if the purpose of the bean was to add natural color or if there was supposed to be an added flavor. But what do I know - I’m not a food critic.</p>
                        <p>A key memory that I have from this night was that I felt ugly and fat. My thighs looked huge when sitting on the bench. I was very aware of all the excess weight on me. I felt so disgusting because I felt the extra fat on me and I just wanted to hide. Everyone was enjoying their food and each other’s company, and I was making sure that I didn’t eat too much or too fast because I didn’t want to look like a pig.</p>
                        <p>The night ended and my car was still parked, ticket free. Despite how I felt through the night, it was a nice change from how most of my nights were - at home. LA walked me to my car which was nice of him. I had to drive him back since it was far from the restaurant. He sort of disappeared the second half of the night. He had stepped out with another girl. I’m not going to lie, I kind of felt jealous. I’m not the type of person that experiences jealousy but I did for a quick moment that night. The reality was that he was out of my league in any capacity, romantic or platonic.</p>

                        <p></p>
                        <p></p>

                        <h4>Meadow Lake</h4>
                        <p>I remember watching a VSauce video on <a href="https://youtu.be/CPBJgpK0Ulc">how people disappear</a> 10 years ago. In the video he mentions in most jurisdictions, if someone is missing and isn’t found, after 5-7 years they are declared “dead in absentia.”</p>
                        <p>It got me thinking about the question of how does one go missing on their own accord? How does one just disappear and start a new life far away? I remember thinking it’s easier to run away and start over if you were on your own to begin with (i.e. no family or friends who would want to look for you). They would need to live on only cash because if they use their cards they would be found through their transaction history. In regards to shelter, their best bet would be living in an RV. The only problem is that maintenance would be expensive. A car would be cheaper, but then storage, cooking, and bathrooms pose potential issues. Bathrooms especially because I hate public bathrooms. For work they would need to work off the books because where would they put their checks? Not their bank account, then they’ll be found. Then came things that were more difficult to resolve, such as the issue of internet for your computer. You can’t have an internet service if you live in a vehicle - routers involve wiring and stuff. You could utilize hotspot, but that involves having a cell phone which could be used to find you. And how do you sign up for a cell phone plan without using your real identity? And then the fact that it is scary to be alone. What if you hear something or see something in the middle of the night? It’s only you and there is no comfort in that. After racking my brain and growing tired of coming up with solutions and alternatives to live your fullest life in hiding, I moved on because it really didn’t matter to 15 year old me.</p>
                        <p>Except it mattered to 23 year old me. Every waking moment I would think about leaving everyone and everything. I would think about going somewhere new and starting over every single day. I was overwhelmed by my job. I felt like a failure for dropping out of all my classes. I was tired all the time. I constantly felt like I had the wind knocked out of me. I’d know, it happened once when I was 9 years old. My neighbor, who was older the me, got mad at me for touching his football. He socked me right in the stomach. I felt like that constantly. I hated that none of the pieces in my life were fitting. It’s like I was trying to put together a puzzle with pieces that were all from a different set. I was tired of my life and I was tired of myself. I hated myself. I was disgusted by myself. Everything that was wrong seemed impossible to fix. With every mistake, embarrassing moment, and failure, the urge to run away grew stronger.</p>
                        <p>I knew that it wasn’t a viable solution. And so, in an effort to temporarily escape my reality, I’d wake up early in the morning and leave for work two hours before I’d need to go in. My workplace was near Meadow Lake of Flushing Meadow Corona Park. Every morning, I’d walk over the overpass on Grand Central Parkway to make my way to the park. I’d watch the moon make way for the sun, the stars disappearing with each ray that broke the night sky. I would hear the birds wake up and chirp their morning song as they welcomed the sun and new day. I’d watch the trees wake up and dance in the wind as their leaves rustled. I’d take solace in the cool, winter breeze and the fresh air as I walked along the water. </p>
                        <p>In those moments, I felt peace and comfort as the open landscape welcomed me, inviting me to explore more of its beauty. I’d feel a sense of hope that just as dark turns into light everyday, maybe one day my sun would shine, too.</p>

                        <p class = "OGMemories">and again: one mountain ash.</p>  
                        <p></p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p class = "OGMemories">And I wouldn't have thought, without traveling out</p>  
                        <p class = "OGMemories">how huge that dipper was.</p>  
                        <p class = "OGMemories">how small that tree.</p>  
                        <p></p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>You know when things spiral so out of control, you can’t even pinpoint the exact moment that it all started. Like there is no defining moment. It was just a whole bunch of little moments. A slow progression if you will. Staples, fingernails, safety pins, nothing to blunt because the intent was to release myself emotionally, not depart physically. I started drawing lines on my arms to cope with all these feelings. I felt lighter afterwards, but it wouldn’t last long. In the long run, I just felt heavier in every aspect. Bad habit number one.</p>
                        <p>Weekends consisted of me going out and biking until sundown. Don’t take this as me being very athletic. I was riding the Citi e-bikes and those things fly like the wind. The e-assist is no joke. Funny story about the Citi e-bikes: I had accidentally purchased a yearly pass sometime around this time. I called customer service and they kindly cancelled the pass and provided me with a refund. However, the annual pass benefits were still actively working because the total charge for my rides was very low compared to what I was paying before. I guess it was kismat because those weekend bike rides were the only thing I looked forward to, in addition to my morning sunrise walks. A normal Saturday routine involved taking the train to Vernon-Jackson Blvd. From there, I’d take a bike and ride over the Pulaski Bridge. I would ride past the Williamsburg Bridge all the way to Brooklyn Heights. Then, I’d turn around and make my way back. Somedays I would take the M train from Williamsburg and walk from El Metro to Forest Hills to take the F back home. Yeah, I could have taken the bus. But, I enjoyed the walk through Middle Village as it is a quaint neighborhood. Some weekends I would walk around Forest Park, hiking on the trails. The trails at Forest Park are really nice. It’s hard to believe you’re even in the city. They are quite expansive, I don’t think I’ve ever walked the entirety of them. I loved those trails. They gave me lovely hugs on days where I felt no love. At some point, I started alternating my morning walks before work between Forest Park and Meadow Lake. </p>
                        <p>All of the above was bad habit number two. I would spend almost the whole day outside and put things I should have been doing on the back burner. I believe I had given up trying. I think deep down I was hoping I’d be gone soon enough, so none of it would really matter anyway.</p>
                        <p>I started therapy around mid January. LA saw my arms and asked about them. He helped me find a therapist and even went with me to the first session. I was embarrassed that he noticed.  No one else did. In all honesty, I think I wanted someone to notice. I was struggling and was starting to feel isolated. I didn’t know how to help myself and was hoping that someone would.</p>
                        <p>Looking back, that was wrong of me. To put pressure on someone else to fix me without doing any of the work myself. Please don’t take the people who help you for granted. People don’t need to help you. They aren’t obligated to. To put the pressure on someone is unfair and taking advantage of their kindness. It’s easy to think you’re the only one down in the dumps, but everyone is dealing with their own shit. For someone to take on someone else’s shit in addition to their own is the realist form of an angel that will ever be encountered. You’re just dealing with your own singular shit. They have double the shit - a shitstorm. </p>
                        <p>Therapy was helpful. My therapist really helped me through a lot of feelings I had shoved down for years. The first session all I did was cry. I wasn’t able to say anything articulate - every time I’d try, I would just cry more. However, after the first session, I started looking forward to Wednesday afternoons. I started keeping a journal at the end of December. That journal was my companion, my best friend. It knew all my secrets. And someone else did, too, because I later realized that my journal was being read by another person. I started guarding it like my life depended on it. Wherever I went, that little purple notebook came with me. In later months, it often felt like my only companion. A companion that I would stupidly throw out in the garbage can at the Brooklyn Bridge as a way to forget everything. That only works in the movies, in real life, stuff like this leaves you feeling even more sad because now you lost something memorable.</p>
                        <p>Through therapy, I began coming to the realization that love shouldn’t be overbearing. And it shouldn’t be conditional. I shouldn’t feel guilty or like a bad person for doing things like wanting friends, hanging out with friends, staying out until 11 pm, or hanging out alone in the city. I realized how much love limited my chance to see the world. I had stayed home and was never able to see how large the Big Dipper is.</p>
                        <p>Thanks to LA, I was able to get the help needed to step out and see a whole new world. And thanks to my therapist, I felt heard for the first time in a long time. She was my anchor and helped me gain the skills needed to push the boundaries that were set in place so that I could start living my life freely without feeling like I’m a bad person for wanting to.</p>

                        <p class = "OGMemories">From my planner - Saturday, February 12th, Lupe Fiasco concert with LA and BR</p>
                        <p>My first concert that I attended was on February 12, 2022. It was a Lupe Fiasco concert. I’ve never heard of Lupe Fiasco until the days leading up to the concert. Side note - he is at MIT as a fellow for the 2022-2023 academic year and you can find his lectures on MIT’s YouTube page. Definitely worth checking out. </p>
                        <p>I digress. I bought the tickets to his concert from a coworker on February 9th for $50. There were a few reasons that prompted this impromptu decision. The first is that I wanted to see a concert and apparently Lupe Fiasco is a good first concert to see. I listened to his Food and Liquor album the days leading up to February 12, and am glad that I made the impromptu decision to go. That whole album is really good. His work is poetry and he’s a very good storyteller.</p>
                        <p>The second reason was that I was testing the boundaries that existed. I took any opportunity that came up to deviate from the norm as a way to assert my right to live my life freely. So, when I heard that LA and some of his friends were going to this concert, I decided to join as well. </p>
                        <p>I was seeing all the experiences that other people my age were having. I wanted to live the lives they were living. A life of color and excitement. Doing so meant staining the clean image I had curated. I would be told to be careful because I was treading dangerous waters. “They don’t actually you as their friend, they just you as a pastime, someone they could gossip about behind your back.” “We’re the only ones who will ever put up with you and be here. You’ll come back to us when they leave.” “The world is selfish. No one cares about anyone. People are backstabbers. It’s all bullshit.” I knew that it was coming from a place of love and protectiveness, though. But, it was frustrating because I didn’t believe that and it was hard for me to keep an open-mind as I tried to open up my world.</p>
                        <p>The concert was really awesome. The music travelled through the floor, up the soles, and poured out as ecstasy among the crowd. At this point, there was another person who I grew closer to. We’ll call him BR. You’ll see in later memories that he was the GOAT. Also, Lupe Fiasco is a very handsome gentleman. Unfortunately, I only got to listen to three songs before I had to head out. I had to be back by 10 pm. I hated that, but I didn’t want to drive the distance between us any farther. On the bright side, it was my first time seeing the Kosciuszko Bridge at night time. It was magical - the bridge all lit up, the skyline shining in the background, the empty road ahead of me. </p>

                        <p></p>
                        <p>My flight to Seattle was on February 18th, 2022. It was my first solo trip. Originally, I had wanted to go to San Francisco, but I didn’t know anyone there. My aunt whose husband died that past summer (the one mentioned in Station House) has two brothers who live in the Seattle suburbs. I loved going to Vancouver. The Pacific Northwest is heaven on earth and while I had driven through Seattle twice, I never actually saw Seattle. I figured it would have a similar scenery and vibe to Vancouver. And thus the decision to go to Seattle was made.</p>
                        <p>On the flight I sat next to this Polish woman in her 50s. Her name was Victoria and she was traveling to Alaska. I was sitting in the aisle seat, Victoria was in the middle seat, and another lady by the window seat. At first Victoria tried to make conversation with the lady by the window seat. The lady had her headphones in and did not reciprocate. Then, Victoria turned to me. I didn’t feel like talking, but felt it wouldn’t have been nice to ignore her. Unfortunately, I did not have any headphones in, so I was unable to pretend I didn’t hear her. I am talkative person with people I feel close to, so I understood the feeling of wanting to have someone to talk to, but no one being there to listen. </p>
                        <p>Victoria asked me where I was traveling to and I told her I was going to Seattle. She was nanny by day, cleaner by night. She was taking the week off to go on vacation to Alaska. She would be meeting up with a group of tourists and go sightseeing and stuff like that. A little bit into the flight refreshments were offered. Victoria helped herself to some alcohol. She started talking about how her first husband was a dick. He wouldn’t work and would take her money. He was also an alcoholic and had anger issues. She ended up leaving him and remarrying. Then, she talked about how the girl she nannies for is really clever, but the mom gets concerned because the girl is more attached to Victoria than her own mother and is also picking up a lot of Polish. </p>
                        <p>Sometimes it was hard to understand her because of her accent, so I would just smile and nod. I had to be careful because sometimes she was actually angry when recounting stories of her past and I’d have to make a facial expression that matched. It would be weird for me to smile if she was actually angry about something. I spent a lot of time trying to read her face and tone so I would react appropriately.</p>
                        <p>Half way through the flight, I pretended to doze off so I could take a breather from our conversation. A second round of refreshments came around. While I was pretending to be asleep, Victoria told the flight attendant if she could get another soda so that she could give it to me when I woke up, as well as a pack of cookies. Victoria is a good soul.</p>
                        <p>We said our goodbyes when the flight landed and I made my way to find our family-friends who would host me for the week. I was nervous because I had only met them a couple times before this. They were a married couple in their late 30s. They had a son and a daughter who were in elementary school. They were really great hosts. I really enjoyed their company and was sad to leave them when my trip came to an end.</p>
                        <p>Seattle is a small city. I was able to see most of it in the first two to three days. I didn’t really do any proper planning for this trip in terms of sightseeing and things to do. My first day started with a ride on the Great Wheel and pancakes for breakfast nearby. After breakfast I explored Pike Place which was a lot of fun. It’s very much like a maze and there were a lot of neat markets and shops. Next, I went on the Underground Seattle Tour which I highly recommend. The history of Seattle is a funny one. In short, it was a city that was build on literal shit. Then, the whole town burned down. No deaths, but a clean slate to start all over, this time without the shit. We got to see the original work that was done to build the plumbing system, and the history behind it. The tour guide was a great storyteller. Afterwards, I took the ferry to Bainbridge. I didn’t stay for too long though because I wanted to be able to catch the ferry back.</p>
                        <p>The days following were just as unplanned as the first day. I went to the Space Needle. There I met another tourist from New York City. He worked for the Board of Elections and had taken the week off to visit Seattle with his friend. I went to Chihuly glass garden as a coworker recommended it. I couldn’t believe that glass could bend like that. I liked the outdoor pieces more than the ones that were indoor. I felt like the surrounding nature added a new life to the artwork and made them seem as alive as the world around it. I went to a dive bar nearby - I had a chicken sandwich, fries, and a slice of apple pie. It was actually pretty good. The place could have been a little bit more warmer, but other than that, it was a pleasant lunch. The thing is that food in New York City is just better. You can’t compare apples and oranges. Each cities cuisine is good in its own way. On this day, I actually tried out the e-bikes in Seattle. They didn’t have pedals and relied on the handles to accelerate and move. There are a lot of steep hills in Seattle so at one point I had to get off the e-bike and push it up the hill. In an attempt to speed up the process, I decided to accelerate the bike using the handles. What followed was the bike getting out of control, flipping out of my hands, and both me and the bike falling on the curb. Don’t do this, it is a very dumb thing to do.</p>
                        <p>The day before my last day I went back to Bainbridge and went to a boutique toy shop where I had bought some more stuffed animals, as well as the post card that I eventually drew my first sketch of this zine on. Those stuffed animals were the most perfect stuffed animals I’ve ever seen. They were so homey and nostalgic. Usually, I am scared of stuffed animals. I have an irrational fear that they will come to life and kill me. Or, that I might see them move from the corner of my eye. These stuffed animals did not look like they would be capable of that.</p>
                        <p>My last day was the perfect day. The sky was blue, the sun was shining, and there was not a cloud in sight. Seattle was kind to me because it only rained one day during my visit. I took the train to Angle Lake and enjoyed the peace, quiet, and fresh air. Afterwards, I took the train to Seattle one last time. I had breakfast by The Great Wheel, took the e-bike around the city, and ventured to Pike Place. I enjoyed being on my own and not having to worry about upsetting anyone or walking on eggshells or any of that. I was glad to have a break from work and not worry about the never ending workload, students, or my boss. I should have been lesson planning but gave up after my third day on break because I really needed a break. My last stop on my way back to my host’s home was Columbia City. I stopped by at a vintage toy store and bought myself another teddy bear, as well as stuffed animals, candy, and coloring books for my host’s kids as a goodbye present. I bought some more coffee beans for LA at a local coffee shop nearby.</p>
                        <p>At this point in time, I was in love with LA. He was everything I wanted to be as a person - determined, motivated, kind, funny, stylish, and smart. I trusted him. The thing is that I knew he wasn’t going to feel the same way about me. I definitely was not his type. And I wasn’t really even sure if he saw me as a solid friend, let alone a possible romantic interested. </p>
                        <p>When I came back from Seattle, I went to his place to drop off the coffee beans. I could have waited until the following week, but I was just looking for an excuse to see him sooner than that. I wonder if my feelings for him were obvious to him, because that would be embarrassing if that were the case. One-sided love is such a bitch.</p>
